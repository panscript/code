# PanScript
Final project / Computer Science (Bachelor) / Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS)

### About
PanScript aims to be a very simple pseudocode language in which every token, such as ``if`` and ``else``, can be translated into any other human language. This allows for regionalized code samples to be taught in the student's native language, hopefully enabling more people to learn and develop programming logic skills. PanScript is free and open-source.

### Code Samples

##### Portuguese:
```
se x == y
    escrever("Iguais!")
senão
    escrever("Diferentes!")
fim
```

##### Spanish:
```
si x == y
    escribir("¡Iguales!")
sino
    escribir("¡Diferentes!")
fin
```
### Additional Information
This project's development process shall be fully documented in a [dev-log](/dev-log) and a [wiki](../../wiki), available only in a private repository. A temporary [GitHub Pages website](https://d-to-the-k.github.io/tcc/) was created to host the project during development. Upon completion, a new repository shall be created to publish everything except for the dev-log.
